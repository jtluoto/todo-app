- Use **TypeScript** for all components, utilities, and API routes.
- Follow **ESLint** and **Prettier** rules for consistent formatting.
- Utilize **React Hooks** efficiently and avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- Always use **server-side rendering (SSR)** or **static site generation (SSG)** where applicable.
- For API calls, use **React Query** or `fetch` with SWR for data fetching.
- Use **Jest** and **React Testing Library** for unit and integration tests.
- Mock API calls to avoid external dependencies in tests.
